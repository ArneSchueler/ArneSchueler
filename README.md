# Frontend / UX Engineer

I design and build accessible, scalable web interfaces.

My focus is on the intersection of **UX, frontend engineering, and design systems** —
turning complex requirements into clear, maintainable, and user-centered solutions.

I care about:
- accessibility as a baseline, not a feature
- clean, understandable UI architecture
- scalable CSS and component systems
- bridging design and implementation without friction
